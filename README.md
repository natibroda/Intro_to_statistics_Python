# Intro_to_statistics_Python

This repository is a practice repository. I will be using it to learn GitHub, as well as to store and organise my practice Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts which I write as I am learning Introduction to Statistics on Udacity.

If you ever happen to see this repository, please forgive my silly mistakes and clumsy code - I have been learning to code on a very part-time basis for just a few weeks.

I do hope, however, that this repository can one day serve as a learning/revision aid for those who - like me - struggle with some of the concepts in basics statistics.
